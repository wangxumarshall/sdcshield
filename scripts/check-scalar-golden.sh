# check-scalar-golden.sh — mechanical gate for the issue #373 paradigm.
#
# The scalar-independent-golden paradigm (docs/coding/writing_tests.md,
# "Golden must be independent of the datapath under test") requires that the
# init-phase golden computation NEVER executes on the vector units under
# test. The switch-phase dispatch in the golden loop is a natural barrier
# against GCC auto-vectorization, but that is a property of the current
# compiler, not a guarantee — this script pins it against the built binary.
#
# For each requested symbol (a test's *_init function, or a run-side golden
# helper such as tlbstress_compute_golden) it disassembles the EXACT symbol
# extent and fails if any vector ALU instruction appears there. Pure data
# movement (ldr/str q, mov v) is allowed: it is not golden computation, and
# a load/store-path fault hits golden bytes and the run-side fresh recompute
# differently, so the miscompare still fires.
#
# Symbol names are C++-mangled in the symtab: the script resolves them by
# substring through nm. A symbol that cannot be resolved, or resolves to an
# empty disassembly, is a FAILURE, not a pass — an empty objdump output
# grep'd for vector instructions is a hollow PASS (the exact trap this
# gate exists to prevent; hit in practice on 2026-11-01).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-scalar-golden.sh <binary> <symbol-substring>...
# Example:
#   scripts/check-scalar-golden.sh builddir/sdcshield \
#       neon_rot_ldr_at_top_init neon_rot_u8x16_init tlbstress_compute_golden
# Exit: 0 = all symbols scalar-clean, 1 = any violation or resolution failure.

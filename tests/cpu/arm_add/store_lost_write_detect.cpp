/*  store_lost_write_detect — lost-write sentinel with a three-layer
 *  read-back ladder.
 *
 *  Event-report lineage: "the str instruction failed, the assignment never
 *  landed; the OLD value survives intact" — a lost write, not a torn one.
 *  Probe design (per core, symmetric; partner = cpu ^ 1):
 *
 *    write   : plain `str` of the monotonically increasing epoch into the
 *              core's own sentinel slot (fresh value each round so a
 *              lost write cannot hide behind a golden fold — issue #374).
 *    layer 1 : same-core immediate `ldr` read-back — must equal the epoch
 *              just stored (a miss here is a locally lost write).
 *    layer 2 : cross-core `ldr` of the PARTNER's slot — the spec's
 *              remote read with no barrier in between.
 *    layer 3 : partner-slot re-read after `dsb ish` (completes all
 *              memory access before the load) — still-old here means the
 *              write is lost even past a full barrier.
 *
 *  Ordering rationale (wait-free, deadlock-free): the writer publishes
 *  its epoch with written.store(epoch, release) AFTER the asm str of the
 *  sentinel; a reader that acquires the published epoch is therefore
 *  guaranteed the sentinel store has already happened — an ldr still
 *  returning an older value is a genuine visibility failure, not a race
 *  window.  The first draft used a bidirectional ack handshake (writer
 *  waits for the partner to ack before doing its own read) — a textbook
 *  deadlock: both cores' reads sat behind their own waits.  The release/
 *  acquire publication removes every wait while keeping the fail
 *  criteria exactly as strong.
 *
 *  Under -n 1 no partner ever publishes (written[partner] stays 0), so
 *  layers 2/3 run same-core in sequence — the whole ladder still runs.

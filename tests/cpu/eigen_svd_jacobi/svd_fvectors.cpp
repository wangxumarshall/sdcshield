 * This piece of code aims to stress test the FMA execution units of
 * the CPU, among others, by repetitively solving the singular value
 * decomposition problem on given input matrices, which involve a lot
 * of matrix multiplication operations underneath.
 *
 * The logic comes from the 3rd party library Eigen. The first thread
 * that gets to run computes a "golden value" of the results, those
 * being output matrices "U" and "V". Subsequent runs have results
 * contrasted to those golden values and, whenever they differ, an
 * error is flagged.
 *
 * This particular version of the Eigen SVD tests go for single
 * precision input matrices and the "Jacobi" SVD algorithm. Since the
 * randomization hardening (H11') the operands are re-rolled per thread
 * from the framework RNG, mapped into [-1, 1) like Mat::Random; the
 * init-time interesting-vector matrix became dead computation with that
 * change and was removed.
 *
 * This test requires at least 2 threads to run.

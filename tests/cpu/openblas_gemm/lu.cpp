 * Stress test for the data-dependent control flow inside OpenBLAS's LAPACK
 * dgesv path (LU factorization with partial pivoting + triangular solve,
 * entered through the LAPACKE C interface — 2605 exported LAPACKE symbols
 * with zero prior coverage in this suite; the openblas_* tests so far only
 * exercised the cblas GEMM surface). Where GEMM is a straight-line vector
 * FMA pipeline over static loop bounds, LU with partial pivoting is built
 * from microstructures GEMM never touches:
 *   - a per-column data-dependent branch: the pivot search compares every
 *     candidate row's magnitude and picks the maximum (idamax), so every
 *     column of the matrix drives a compare/select decision — a bit flip
 *     in a comparator, a flag register, or a mispredicted branch recovery
 *     path lands directly in the permutation;
 *   - a row-swap store pattern: the chosen rows are exchanged with strided
 *     gather/scatter stores before elimination, a store addressing pattern
 *     disjoint from GEMM's blocked streaming stores;
 *   - triangular back-substitution: sequential dependence along the
 *     diagonal (column k's elimination feeds column k+1's operands), so a
 *     corrupted intermediate propagates forward instead of being masked.
 * The pivot sequence is compared as a first-class result: a wrong pivot
 * choice is direct evidence of a branch/compare-path SDC, visible in the
 * ipiv permutation array before it corrupts any floating-point factor.
 * Each iteration copies the inputs, runs LAPACKE_dgesv, and byte-compares
 * three arrays against golden values from init (copy->compute->verify, the
 * most frequent CORE179 trigger structure): the packed L\U factors (n^2
 * doubles), the ipiv pivot sequence (n ints), and the solution x
 * (n doubles, nrhs=1). All three are deterministic: the same input bits
 * through the same binary always produce the same pivot choices, so a
 * byte-exact memcmp is valid.
 * The matrix dimension is runtime-configurable via the test knob
 * "-O openblas_lu.n=N" (16..2048, default 256; the test-id prefix is
 * required — a bare "n=N" is silently ignored). The knob sweeps the
 * working set across L1D (64KB) / L2 (512KB) / LLC / DRAM on TSV110
 * (64: 32KB, 256: 512KB, 1024: 8MB, 2048: 32MB per matrix) at an O(n^3)
 * flop budget per iteration (2048^3 = 8.6e9 flops, matching the mdim 2048
 * GEMM class).
 * Note on the ROW_MAJOR layout: LAPACKE_dgesv internally transposes to
 * column-major, calls LAPACK_dgesv, and transposes back, allocating and
 * freeing its transposition work buffers with plain malloc/free inside
 * each call (lapacke_dgesv_work.c). Those buffers are call-local, and the
 * underlying OpenBLAS build is USE_LOCKING=1 (see tests/cpu/meson.build),
 * so concurrent calls from the framework's one-worker-per-core threads are
 * safe — the same reasoning that makes concurrent cblas_dgemm safe. The
 * buffers this test itself writes (ac/ipivc/xc) are thread-local.

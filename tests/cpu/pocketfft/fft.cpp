 * FFT stress via pocketfft (BSD-3, the classic SciPy FFT engine, master
 * C edition): a complex forward cfft whose iterative multi-pass
 * factorisation (radix 4/2 for N=4096) walks twiddle-FMA butterfly
 * chains and bit-reversal-style decimation-in-frequency reordering —
 * store->load scatter pressure across the working set, the access
 * structure that discriminates the CORE179 defect. Each iteration
 * copies the input, runs the forward transform and byte-compares the
 * spectrum against the init-time golden spectrum (deterministic for
 * fixed input + fixed binary). The inverse cfft (1/N scaling) is then
 * run as pure additional load: the forward->backward round trip is NOT
 * bit-exact under FFT rounding (measured max rel err ~3e-11 on this
 * very payload) and is therefore never compared — the SDC verdict
 * comes exclusively from the golden-spectrum memcmp.
 *
 * The transform length is runtime-configurable via the test knob
 * "-O pocketfft_fft.n=N" (test-id prefix required — a bare "n=N" is
 * silently ignored), selecting between three distinct algorithm
 * lineages inside pocketfft.c (make_cfft_plan, pocketfft.c:2073):
 * length<50 or largest_prime_factor(N)<=sqrt(N) picks the packed
 * multi-pass plan (cfftp), anything else picks Bluestein. The
 * whitelist therefore covers:
 * - powers of two (512..16384, default 4096): pure radix-4/radix-2
 *   multi-pass (pass4f/pass2f), the historical behavior;
 * - primes 4099/8191: largest_prime_factor(N)==N>sqrt(N) forces the
 *   Bluestein path — FFT re-expressed as a convolution, i.e. two
 *   extra complex FFTs of length good_size(2N-1) plus pointwise
 *   complex multiplies (fftblue_fft, pocketfft.c:1945): a completely
 *   different instruction sequence and memory pattern;
 * - mixed radix 6144 (3*2^11) and 10000 (2^4*5^4): packed plans whose
 *   factorisation mixes radf3/radf5 with radf2/radf4 passes in ONE
 *   transform, exercising the generic odd-radix butterflies.
 * Values outside the whitelist fail loudly (this is a lineage table,
 * not a validity check — pocketfft accepts any N).
 *
 * A second, independent segment exercises rfft_forward: real input,
 * halfcomplex-packed output in the same n doubles (a third transform
 * structure: the real-input packing halves the stored spectrum and
 * walks the radf* butterflies with different data layouts). Its
 * spectrum is likewise byte-compared against an init-time golden.
 * The inverse transforms (cfft_backward AND rfft_backward) are verified
 * with a tolerance round-trip check: neither round trip is bit-exact under
 * FFT rounding (measured max rel err ~3e-11), so their outputs are compared
 * against the original inputs at 1e-6 relative — catching gross inverse-path
 * corruption (dead butterfly, corrupted twiddle table) without false
 * positives on healthy silicon.
